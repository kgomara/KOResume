This repository contains the code the KOResume Example.

There are versions for iOS and Android; the server folder is intentionaly empty.

The project grew out of a job application where the company wanted to see an example of candidate's work. It evolved
into a fully-featured iOS app, then an Android version, and then an upgrade to the iOS version that included
iCloud integration.

Build Instructions:

The projects are standard iOS and Android applications developed in Xcode and Eclipse respectively. There is nothing 
unusual about their build processes - of course the standard process of building an iOS app for distribution is 
somewhat complex but is well document on developer.apple.com and elsewhere. Keep in mind that due to the iCloud 
integration the app "bundle id" must be specific (cannot be the wildcard '*'), and the AppID must be configured for
iCloud.
