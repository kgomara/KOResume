I'd claim MVC pattern as the Cocoa framework nearly demands it - but in this case I choose simplicity and have no real data model.  All the "data" in the app is either embedded directly in the View as UILabel text or loaded in viewDidLoad methods.

There is extensive use of delegates in UITableView data sources and delegates.  In addition, there is a simple delegate used for UIScrollView.
